Our main involement comes from preparing the soil and planting the bushes. We do not use any pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. We do not irrigate our blueberries, so we are at the mercy of the weather. We believe this is the best way to grow blueberries. We are not certified organic, but we are better than organic.",
